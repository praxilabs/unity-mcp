# ORStep

## Overview
ORStep provides logical Or-ing of sequence branches for multiple choice scenarios where only one option needs to be selected in virtual lab experiments.

## Node Details

**File**: [ORStep.cs](mdc:Assets/Scripts/System/xNode/Steps/ActionExecuted/ORStep.cs)
**Purpose**: Logical Or-ing of sequence branches
**Usage**: Multiple routes where only one must be taken

## Common Patterns

### Multiple Choice Selection
```
ORStep (User choice) → Option A: ExecuteOptionA → ...
                    → Option B: ExecuteOptionB → ...
                    → Option C: ExecuteOptionC → ...
```

## Critical ORStep Rules
- **Single Selection**: Only one option needs to be selected to proceed
- **Multiple Options**: Provide multiple alternative paths
- **Clear Options**: Use descriptive option names for user clarity
