# IfStatementStep

## Overview
IfStatementStep provides boolean conditional branching for decision points and conditional execution paths in virtual lab experiments.

## Node Details

**File**: [IfStatementStep.cs](mdc:Assets/Scripts/System/xNode/Steps/SelfExecuted/ControlFlow/IfStatementStep.cs)
**Purpose**: Boolean conditional branching
**Outputs**: `True`, `False`
**Usage**: Decision points, error checking

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Execution
```
IfStatementStep (Check condition) → True: Execute Action A → ...
                                  → False: Execute Action B → ...
```


## Critical IfStatementStep Rules
- **True Port**: Executes when condition is met (condition = true)
- **False Port**: Executes when condition is unmet (condition = false)
- **Handle Both Cases**: Always provide logic for both True and False paths

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing False case**: Always handle both True and False in IfStatementStep
