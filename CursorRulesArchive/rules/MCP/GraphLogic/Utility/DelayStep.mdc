# DelayStep

## Overview
DelayStep provides timing control in virtual lab experiments. Used for waiting specified time periods, pacing experiments, and controlling timing between actions.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: DelayStep
**Purpose**: Wait for specified time for system timing control
**Usage**: Timing between actions, pacing experiments, smooth transitions

## Basic Prerequisites
- None 

## Parameters

- **Duration**: Time to wait in seconds

## Critical DelayStep Rules
- **Fixed System Delay**: Use for fixed system timing, not user-controlled timing
- **NOT User-Controlled**: Use TimerStep for user-controlled timing with UI controls
- **System Pacing**: Use for smooth transitions and system pacing

## Common Patterns

### Timing Control Pattern
```
Action A → DelayStep (wait) → Action B → Continue
```
