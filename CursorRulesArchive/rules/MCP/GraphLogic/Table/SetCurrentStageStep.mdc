# SetCurrentStageStep Node

## Overview
Sets the experiment's current stage to a specified stage for explicit stage navigation and resuming from specific points.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: SetCurrentStageStep
**Purpose**: Set active stage
**Usage**: Navigate/resume from a specific stage

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Valid Stage Name**: Target stage must exist in the experiment
2. **Stage Configuration**: Stage must be properly configured
3. **Stage Registry**: Stage must be registered in the stage registry

## Parameters

- **stageName**: Target stage identifier

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Stage Setting
```
IfStatementStep (Condition) → SetCurrentStageStep (SuccessStage)
IfStatementStep (NOT Condition) → SetCurrentStageStep (FailureStage)
```

## Critical SetCurrentStageStep Rules
- **Explicit Stage Navigation**: Use for explicit stage navigation and resuming
- **Stage Setting**: Sets the current active stage to specified stage
- **Conditional Routing**: Enables conditional stage routing based on conditions
