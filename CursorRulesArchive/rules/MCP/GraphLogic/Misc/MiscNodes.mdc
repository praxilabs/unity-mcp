# Misc Nodes

## Overview
Misc nodes handle various operations that don't fit into other categories, including animation control, stage progression, and subgraph execution in virtual lab experiments.

## Available Nodes

### AnimationStep
**Rule File**: [AnimationStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/Misc/AnimationStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Animation control and playback
**Usage**: Object animations, visual effects, click-triggered responses

### GoToStageStep
**Rule File**: [GoToStageStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/Misc/GoToStageStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Stage transition control
**Usage**: End of a stage, skipping stages

## Common Misinterpretations

## Critical Misc Rules
- **Animation Control**: Use AnimationStep for object animations and visual effects
- **Stage Management**: Use GoToStageStep for stage transitions, not step progression
- **Modular Design**: Use SubGraphStep for reusable experiment components

## Node Selection Guide

### **Use AnimationStep for:**
- Object animations and visual effects
- Click-triggered responses
- Visual feedback for user actions

### **Use GoToStageStep for:**
- Stage transitions within experiments
- Skipping stages based on conditions
- Ending current stage and starting another
