# UIClickStep Node

## Overview
UIClickStep is a **WAIT-FOR-USER-INPUT** node that waits for user to click a UI button before allowing execution to continue. The complexity of what happens after the click depends on the steps that are getting executed after the UIClickStep.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: UIClickStep
**Purpose**: Wait for user to click UI Canvas buttons, then allow execution to continue
**Usage**: UI interaction gate for dialog boxes, interface panels, and menu buttons
**Context**: Use for Unity UI buttons on Canvas elements, not 3D world objects

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **UI Button**: Required UI button element in the scene
2. **Button Script**: Required button script to handle click events
3. **UI Canvas**: Required UI canvas containing the button

## Parameters

- **Target Button**: The UI button to click

## Critical Notes
Don't use a UI Click Step on its own, you have to make the logic yourself as the UI Click Step itself contains no logic.

## Common Patterns

### Data Operations:
```
UIClickStep (Save Results Button) → FunctionCallStep(DataManager.SaveExperiment) → Continue
UIClickStep (Export Data Button) → FunctionCallStep(DataExporter.ExportToCSV) → Continue
```

### Confirmation Actions:
```
UIClickStep (Delete Confirmation) → FunctionCallStep(DataManager.DeleteExperiment) → Continue
UIClickStep (Reset Equipment) → FunctionCallStep(LabController.ResetAllEquipment) → Continue
```

## Common Mistakes
1. **Confusing UI vs 3D interactions**: Using UIClickStep for 3D laboratory equipment
2. **Ignoring complexity assessment**: Not determining if the UI action needs additional steps

## Best Practices
3. **Distinguish from 3D interactions**: UIClickStep for Canvas UI, ClickStep for 3D objects
4. **Use appropriate function calls**: Most complex UI actions need FunctionCallStep connections

##  UI vs 3D Click Decision
**Use UIClickStep for:**
- **Unity UI Canvas buttons**: Dialog boxes, panels, menus
- **Interface popups**: Confirmation dialogs, settings panels
- **Navigation elements**: Next, back, continue buttons in UI
- **Data interface buttons**: Save, load, export in laboratory software

**Use ClickStep for:**
- **3D laboratory equipment**: Physical buttons on instrument models
- **Laboratory objects**: Beakers, test tubes, apparatus in 3D scene
- **Equipment controls**: Power buttons, knobs, switches on 3D instruments
- **Physical interactions**: Objects with colliders in the laboratory environment
