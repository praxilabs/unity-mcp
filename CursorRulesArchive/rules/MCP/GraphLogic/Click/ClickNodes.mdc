# Click Nodes

## Overview
Click nodes handle user clicking interactions in virtual lab experiments. Essential for user interface interactions, object selection, and interactive object manipulation.

## Available Nodes

### ClickStep
**Rule File**: [ClickStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/Click/ClickStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Wait for user to click target object, then enable execution flow
**Usage**: Object interaction gate, world GameObject clicking
**Critical**: ClickStep acts as a gate that stops execution until a click happens.

### RotateKnobStep
**Rule File**: [RotateKnobStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/Click/RotateKnobStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Handle knob rotation interactions
**Usage**: Instrument controls, value adjustments

### ExploreStep
**Rule File**: [ExploreStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/Click/ExploreStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Handle object exploration interactions
**Usage**: Object inspection, detailed examination

### UIClickStep
**Rule File**: [ClickUIButtonStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/Click/ClickUIButtonStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Wait for user to click UI button, then enable execution flow
**Usage**: UI button interaction gate, interface button clicking
**Critical**: ClickStep acts as a gate that stops execution until a click happens.

## Button Type by Implementation Context

### ClickStep (3D World Objects):
- **Physical buttons on 3D instrument models**: Buttons that are part of the 3D equipment mesh/model
- **Interactive 3D objects in the scene**: GameObjects with colliders in the 3D world
- **Laboratory equipment controls**: Physical controls on instruments, apparatus, devices
- Hint: always search for keywords like physical or any indicator that shows that this button is not a UI button, if you get that confused then return to the User with a question inquiring about this detail.


### UIClickStep (UI Canvas Elements):
- **Unity UI buttons on Canvas**: Buttons in dialog boxes, panels, HUDs
- **Interface popups and dialogs**: Yes/No, OK/Cancel, confirmation dialogs
- **Menu and navigation elements**: Start, Next, Continue, navigation buttons
