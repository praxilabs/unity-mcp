# ForLoopStep Node

## Overview
Executes its body a fixed number of times for repeated measurements and data collection with known iteration count.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: ForLoopStep
**Purpose**: Fixed iteration control
**Usage**: Repeated measurements, data collection

## Parameters

- **iterations**: Integer number of times to execute the loop body

## Ports

- **Entry**: the node entry point, and also the port that should be responsible for looping.
- **continueLoop (Output)**: The continue loop should be connectd to whatever logic is about to execute in the loop then the last node should connect to the entry again.
- **exit (Output)**: Called after the final iteration completes

## Common Patterns

### Fixed Iteration Pattern
```
`...` indicates a variable number of nodes that does a certain logic.

ForLoopStep (iterations: 5) → continueLoop: ... → ForLoopStep.entry
                            → exit: ...
```


## Critical ForLoopStep Rules
- **Fixed Iterations**: Use for known, finite iteration counts
- **Port Connections**: Use `continueLoop` for loop body, `exit` for completion
- **Finite Execution**: Loop will always terminate after specified iterations
