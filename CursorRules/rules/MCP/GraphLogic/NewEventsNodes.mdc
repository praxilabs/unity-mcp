# NewEvents Nodes

## 📋 Overview
NewEvents nodes handle event-driven interactions in virtual lab experiments. These nodes are essential for reactive programming and event handling.

## 🔧 Available Nodes

### EventCallerStep
**Purpose**: Handle event-driven interactions
**Usage**: Reactive programming, event handling
**Best Practices**:
- Use for reactive programming scenarios
- Handle event triggers appropriately
- Connect to event responses

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Triggering an event in the middle of execution
```
AnyNode → EventCaller(Specifically Registered Event Name) → AnyNode
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes
-ussage of incorrect event name.
-not registering the event in the Event Registry.

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

1. **Test event execution** one step at a time
2. **Verify event triggers** are correct
3. **Check event conditions** and states
4. **Use DelayStep** to slow down for debugging
5. **Monitor event execution** with console logs
6. **Test event sequences** end-to-end
7. **Validate event responses** and outputs
8. **Check event dependencies** and prerequisites
