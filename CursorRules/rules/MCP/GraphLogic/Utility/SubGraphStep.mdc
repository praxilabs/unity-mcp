# SubGraphStep

## 📋 Overview
SubGraphStep executes other graphs as subroutines in virtual lab experiments. Used for modular experiment design, reusable procedures, and breaking complex experiments into manageable components.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: SubGraphStep
**Purpose**: Execute other graphs as subroutines for modular design
**Usage**: Modular experiment design, reusable procedures, complex experiment breakdown

## 📋 Basic Prerequisites

1. **SubGraph Reference**: Valid reference to another StepsGraph asset
2. **Entry/Exit Points**: SubGraph must have proper entry and exit points
3. **Step Number**: Use stepNumber parameter for clear progression (optional)
4. **No Circular References**: Avoid infinite subgraph loops

## 📝 Parameters

- **SubGraph Asset**: Reference to the StepsGraph asset to execute
- **Step Number**: Sequential step number for progression tracking (optional)

## 🚨 Critical SubGraphStep Rules
- **Modular Design**: Use for breaking complex experiments into manageable components
- **Reusable Procedures**: Create reusable sub-procedures for common operations
- **No Circular References**: Avoid infinite subgraph loops
- **Proper Entry/Exit**: Ensure subgraphs have proper entry and exit points

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Modular Execution Pattern
```
SubGraphStep (Setup procedure) → Main experiment → SubGraphStep (Cleanup procedure) → Continue
```

### Multi-Phase Experiment Pattern
```
SubGraphStep (Phase 1) → SubGraphStep (Phase 2) → SubGraphStep (Phase 3) → Continue
```

### Sequential SubGraph Execution Pattern
```
SubGraphStep (Step_01) → SubGraphStep (Step_01.5) → SubGraphStep (Step_02) → Continue
```

### Step-Numbered Progression Pattern
```
SubGraphStep (Step_01, stepNumber: 1) → SubGraphStep (Step_02, stepNumber: 2) → 
SubGraphStep (Step_03, stepNumber: 3) → SubGraphStep (Step_04, stepNumber: 4) → Continue
```

### Hint-Guided Sequential Flow Pattern
```
HintStep (stepNumber: 1) → SubGraphStep (Phase 1) → HintStep (stepNumber: 2) → 
SubGraphStep (Phase 2) → HintStep (stepNumber: 3) → SubGraphStep (Phase 3) → Continue
```

### SubGraph with Auto Progress Pattern
```
SubGraphStep (Complete phase) → ProgressMapAutoNextStep → SubGraphStep (Next phase) → Continue
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Infinite subgraphs**: Avoid circular subgraph references
2. **Missing subgraph references**: Ensure subgraph references are valid
3. **Incomplete subgraph flow**: Ensure subgraphs have proper entry and exit points
4. **Missing step numbers**: Use stepNumber parameter for clear progression
5. **Wrong subgraph order**: Ensure subgraphs execute in correct sequence

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use for modular experiment design** and reusable procedures
2. **Create reusable sub-procedures** for common operations
3. **Use stepNumber parameter** for clear progression tracking
4. **Break complex experiments** into manageable phases
5. **Ensure subgraphs have proper entry and exit points**
6. **Avoid circular subgraph references** to prevent infinite loops
