# DelayStep

## 📋 Overview
DelayStep provides timing control in virtual lab experiments. Used for waiting specified time periods, pacing experiments, and controlling timing between actions.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: DelayStep
**Purpose**: Wait for specified time for system timing control
**Usage**: Timing between actions, pacing experiments, smooth transitions

## 📋 Basic Prerequisites

1. **Delay Duration**: Set appropriate delay duration in seconds
2. **Timing Context**: Understand why the delay is needed
3. **User Experience**: Consider impact on user experience
4. **Execution Flow**: Place delay appropriately in execution sequence

## 📝 Parameters

- **Duration**: Time to wait in seconds
- **Context**: Reason for the delay (optional but recommended)

## 🚨 Critical DelayStep Rules
- **Fixed System Delay**: Use for fixed system timing, not user-controlled timing
- **NOT User-Controlled**: Use TimerStep for user-controlled timing with UI controls
- **System Pacing**: Use for smooth transitions and system pacing

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Timing Control Pattern
```
Action A → DelayStep (wait) → Action B → Continue
```

### Completion Flow Delay Pattern
```
FunctionCallStep (MarkScenarioComplete) → DelayStep (0.3s) → ShowCompletionMessage
```

### Message Transition Delay Pattern
```
ShowMessage → DelayStep (0.5s) → ShowNextMessage
```

### Camera Transition Delay Pattern
```
FunctionCallStep (GoToBirdEye) → DelayStep (0.2s) → FunctionCallStep (ToggleBirdEyeUI) → Continue
```

### Object Appearance Pattern
```
GameObjectSetActiveStep (hide) → DelayStep → GameObjectSetActiveStep (show) → DelayStep → ...
```

### Sequential Function Calls Pattern
```
FunctionCallStep (Setup function) → DelayStep → FunctionCallStep (Main function) → ShowMessage (Complete)
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Wrong delay duration**: Set appropriate timing for delays
2. **Too short delays**: Delays that are too short may cause visual issues
3. **Too long delays**: Delays that are too long may frustrate users
4. **Wrong node choice**: Use TimerStep for user-controlled timing, not DelayStep
5. **Inconsistent delay timing**: Use consistent delay durations throughout experiments

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Set appropriate delay duration** for the context
2. **Use for system pacing** and smooth transitions
3. **Use consistent delay durations** for similar operations
4. **Consider user experience** when setting delay durations
5. **Use for fixed system timing** only
6. **Provide context** for why delays are needed
