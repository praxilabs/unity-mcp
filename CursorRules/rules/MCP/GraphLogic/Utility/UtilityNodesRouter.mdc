      <description>This is a ROUTING RULE ONLY - it does not provide functional tools or capabilities. This rule only routes you to the appropriate node rules for detailed implementation. For actual node implementation, refer to the specific node rules: FreezeLabStep.mdc, DelayStep.mdc, SubGraphStep.mdc, ToggleDeviceCollidersStep.mdc, and ToggleUIButtonInteractionStep.mdc.</description>
    </non-negotiable>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use FreezeLabStep for freeze/unfreeze lab interactions, pause functionality, and modal dialogs. Provides system-wide interaction control for pause and modal dialog scenarios.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use DelayStep for wait for specified time, timing between actions, and pacing experiments. Provides fixed system timing control for smooth transitions and system pacing.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use SubGraphStep for execute other graphs as subroutines, modular experiment design, and reusable procedures. Enables breaking complex experiments into manageable components.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use ToggleDeviceCollidersStep for enable/disable colliders on multiple devices, device interaction control, and safety systems. Manages multiple device colliders simultaneously.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use ToggleUIButtonInteractionStep for enable/disable UI button interactions, UI control, and button state management. Controls user interface interactions and button states.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="critical">
      <description>Distinguish between system timing and user-controlled timing. Use DelayStep for fixed system timing, TimerStep for user-controlled timing with UI controls.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="critical">
      <description>Distinguish between single device and multiple device operations. Use ToggleColliderStep for single device operations, ToggleDeviceCollidersStep for multiple device operations.</description>

  <context description="Additional considerations for utility nodes">
    Utility nodes handle system utility operations in virtual lab experiments. These nodes are essential for system control, timing, and modular execution. They provide the foundational capabilities for managing system state, timing, and modular experiment design.
