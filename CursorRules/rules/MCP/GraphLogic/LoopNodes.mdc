# Loop Nodes

## üìã Overview
Loop nodes handle iterative operations in virtual lab experiments. These nodes are essential for repeated actions and data collection.

## üîß Available Nodes

### ForLoopStep
**Purpose**: Fixed iteration control
**Usage**: Repeated measurements, data collection
**Best Practices**:
- Set appropriate iteration count
- always connect the continueLoop port to the entry.
- any node that is connected to the exit indicates the node logic that will be executed when the loop terminates.

### WhileLoopStep
**Purpose**: Conditional iteration control
**Usage**: Conditional repetition, dynamic loops
**Best Practices**:
- Set clear exit conditions
- ALWAYS connect the continueLoop port to the entry.
- any node that is connected to the exit indicates the node logic that will be executed when the loop terminates.
- ALWAYS connect a global variable to the isTrue port, as this will be the condition of termination.

## üèóÔ∏è Common Patterns

### Fixed Iteration Pattern
```
ForLoopStep (iterations: 5) ‚Üí continueLoop: Action ‚Üí ForLoopStep (continue)
                           ‚Üí exit: Continue
```

### Conditional Loop Pattern
```
WhileLoopStep (condition) ‚Üí continueLoop: Action ‚Üí Self
                         ‚Üí exit: Continue
```

### Data Collection Pattern
```
ForLoopStep (iterations: 10) ‚Üí continueLoop: CollectData ‚Üí Self
                             ‚Üí exit: ShowResults
```

### Interactive Loop Pattern
```
WhileLoopStep (user continues) ‚Üí continueLoop: UserAction ‚Üí WhileLoopStep (check)
                              ‚Üí exit: Complete
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

1. **Infinite loops**: Always ensure exit conditions are met
2. **Wrong port connections**: Use continueLoop for loop body, exit for completion
4. **Unclear conditions**: Use clear boolean conditions for WhileLoopStep

## üîç Debugging Tips

1. **Test loop logic** with small iteration counts
2. **Verify exit conditions** are reachable
3. **Check port connections** (continueLoop vs exit)
4. **Use DelayStep** to slow down loop execution for debugging
5. **Monitor loop progress** with console logs# Loop Nodes
