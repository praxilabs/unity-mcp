# FocusOnToolStep Node

## 📋 Overview
FocusOnToolStep controls camera positioning to focus on specific objects in virtual lab experiments. This node is essential for guided attention, close-up views, and providing detailed views of objects.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: FocusOnToolStep
**Purpose**: Focus camera on specific objects
**Usage**: Guided attention, close-up views, object examination

## 📋 Basic Prerequisites

<!-- Required data and setup needed for this node step to work -->
1. ToolsCameraTarget Script.
2. Virtual Camera that focuses on the Object you want to use the step on.

## 📝 Parameters

- **Target Object**: The object to focus the camera on
- **Focus Distance**: Distance from the target object
- **Focus Angle**: Camera angle relative to the target
- **Transition Duration**: Time for camera movement
- **Focus Type**: Type of focus (close-up, overview, etc.)

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Basic Object Focus
```
FocusOnToolStep (Object) → ShowMessage (Object details) → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Guided Attention Pattern
```
ShowMessage (Look at this) → FocusOnToolStep (Target object) → DelayStep → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Interactive Focus Pattern
```
ClickStep (Object) → FocusOnToolStep (Object) → ShowMessage (Detailed info) → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Multiple Object Focus (Correct Pattern)
```
FocusOnToolStep (Object A) → ShowMessage (Details A) → ReturnCameraStep → FocusOnToolStep (Object B) → ShowMessage (Details B) → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Camera Sequence Pattern (Correct Pattern)
```
FocusOnToolStep (Setup area) → ShowMessage (Setup instructions) → ReturnCameraStep → FocusOnToolStep (Tool) → ShowMessage (Tool usage) → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Examination Flow
```
FocusOnToolStep (Object) → DelayStep → ShowMessage (Examine this) → ReturnCameraStep → Continue
```

## 🚨 Critical Camera Rules

### **System Architecture**
The camera system tracks only **ONE previous camera position** (main camera), not a stack. This requires strict management.

### **Mandatory ReturnCameraStep Rules**
1. **Focus → Focus (Different Tools)**: `FocusOnToolStep(Tool1)` → [any nodes] → `ReturnCameraStep` → `FocusOnToolStep(Tool2)` (**MANDATORY**)
2. **Focus → Focus (Same Tool)**: `FocusOnToolStep(Tool1)` → [any nodes] → `ReturnCameraStep` → `FocusOnToolStep(Tool1)` (**MANDATORY**)
3. **Single Focus Only**: `FocusOnToolStep(Tool)` → [non-focus operations] → Continue (**ReturnCameraStep OPTIONAL**)
4. **Experiment End**: Final `ReturnCameraStep` (**RECOMMENDED** for polish, not mandatory)

### **Core Rule**
**ANY time you use FocusOnToolStep and later want to use FocusOnToolStep again (same or different tool), you MUST use ReturnCameraStep between them.**

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Missing ReturnCameraStep between focus operations**: If you use FocusOnToolStep twice (same or different tools), you MUST use ReturnCameraStep between them
2. **Wrong focus targets**: Verify focus targets exist in scene  
3. **Chaining focus steps**: Never use FocusOnToolStep → FocusOnToolStep directly without ReturnCameraStep
4. **Invalid object references**: Verify target objects are valid
5. **Missing camera transitions**: Use appropriate delays for camera movements
6. **Misunderstanding "always required"**: ReturnCameraStep is only required between focus operations, not after every single focus

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Use ReturnCameraStep between focus operations** to maintain proper camera tracking
2. **Provide clear user feedback** for camera movements
3. **Use appropriate delays** for smooth camera transitions
4. **Verify target objects exist** before focusing
5. **Test camera sequences** thoroughly
6. **Handle focus failures** gracefully
7. **End experiments with ReturnCameraStep** for professional polish (recommended)
