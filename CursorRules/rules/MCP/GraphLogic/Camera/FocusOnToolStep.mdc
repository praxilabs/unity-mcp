# FocusOnToolStep Node

## Overview
FocusOnToolStep controls camera positioning to focus on specific objects in virtual lab experiments. This node is essential for guided attention, close-up views, and providing detailed views of objects.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: FocusOnToolStep
**Purpose**: Focus camera on specific objects
**Usage**: Guided attention, close-up views, object examination

## Basic Prerequisites

1. Virtual Camera that focuses on the Object you want to use the step on.
2. ToolsCameraTarget Script - The Script handles the camera activation and deactivation and needs The Virtual Camera reference.

## Parameters

- **Target Object**: The object to focus the camera on

## Common Patterns

### Press to Focus then Return.
```
    ClickStep(Device) → FocusOnToolStep(Device) → ... → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Focus on more than one Device sequentially (Device1 then Device2).
```
    ... → FocusOnToolStep(Device1) → ... → ReturnCameraStep → FocusOnToolStep(Device2)
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing ReturnCameraStep between focus operations**: If you use FocusOnToolStep twice (same or different tools), you MUST use ReturnCameraStep between them
2. **Missing camera transitions**: Use appropriate delays for camera movements

## Best Practices
1. **End experiments with ReturnCameraStep** for professional polish (recommended)
