# Camera Nodes

## 📋 Overview
Camera nodes control camera positioning and focus in virtual lab experiments. These nodes are essential for guided attention, view management, and providing detailed views of objects.

## 🔧 Available Nodes

### FocusOnToolStep
**Purpose**: Focus camera on specific objects
**Usage**: Guided attention, close-up views
**Best Practices**:
- Use for highlighting important objects
- Connect to immediate response actions

### ReturnCameraStep
**Purpose**: Return camera to default position
**Usage**: Reset view, overview mode
**Best Practices**:
- Use after detailed views
- Return to overview for context
- Connect to continuation actions

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Object Examination Pattern
```
FocusOnToolStep (Object) → ShowMessage (Object details) → ReturnCameraStep → Continue
```

### Guided Attention Pattern
```
ShowMessage (Look at this) → FocusOnToolStep (Target object) → DelayStep → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Multiple Object Focus
```
FocusOnToolStep (Object A) → ShowMessage (Details A) → FocusOnToolStep (Object B) → ShowMessage (Details B) → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Interactive Focus Pattern
```
ClickStep (Object) → FocusOnToolStep (Object) → ShowMessage (Detailed info) → ReturnCameraStep
```

### Camera Sequence Pattern
```
FocusOnToolStep (Setup area) → ShowMessage (Setup instructions) → FocusOnToolStep (Tool) → ShowMessage (Tool usage) → ReturnCameraStep
```


## 🔍 Debugging Tips

2. **Test camera movements** one step at a time
3. **Check object visibility** before focusing
4. **Use DelayStep** to slow down camera movements for debugging
