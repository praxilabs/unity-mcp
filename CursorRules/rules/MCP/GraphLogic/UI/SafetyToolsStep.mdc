# SafetyToolsStep Node

## Overview
Displays safety-related tools and warnings for safety protocols, hazard warnings, and safety equipment guidance.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: SafetyToolsStep
**Purpose**: Display safety-related tools and warnings
**Usage**: Safety protocols, hazard warnings, safety equipment guidance

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Safety Content**: Safety warning or instruction text must be prepared
2. **Safety Level**: Determine level of safety concern (low, medium, high)
3. **Acknowledgment Logic**: Whether user must acknowledge safety warning
4. **Safety Tools**: List of safety tools to display (if applicable)

## Parameters

- **Safety Message**: The safety warning or instruction
- **Safety Level**: Level of safety concern (low, medium, high)
- **Safety Tools**: List of safety tools to display
- **Acknowledgment Required**: Whether user must acknowledge safety warning

## Critical SafetyToolsStep Rules
- **Safety Focus Only**: Use for safety-related information and warnings
- **Prominent Display**: Safety messages must be prominent and attention-grabbing
- **Acknowledgment Required**: Critical safety warnings should require user acknowledgment

## Common Patterns

### Safety Protocol Pattern
```
SafetyToolsStep (Safety warning) → UserAcknowledges → SafetyCheck → Continue
```

### Hazard Warning
```
SafetyToolsStep (Hazard warning) → UserReadsWarning → AcknowledgeSafety → Continue
```

### Pre-Experiment Safety
```
StartExperiment → SafetyToolsStep (Safety briefing) → UserAcknowledges → BeginExperiment → Continue
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **Inadequate safety warnings**: Ensure safety messages are prominent and clear
2. **Missing acknowledgment**: Require user acknowledgment for critical safety warnings
3. **Unclear safety instructions**: Make safety requirements clear and actionable
4. **Wrong node choice**: Use for safety information, not general messaging

## Best Practices

1. **Use for critical safety information** that users must see
2. **Make safety warnings prominent** and attention-grabbing
3. **Require acknowledgment** for critical safety warnings
4. **Provide clear safety instructions** and requirements
5. **Follow safety protocol standards** for your domain
6. **Ensure safety messages are accessible** and readable
