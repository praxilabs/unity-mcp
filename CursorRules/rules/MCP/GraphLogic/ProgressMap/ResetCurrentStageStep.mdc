# ResetCurrentStageStep Node

## 📋 Overview
Resets progress within the active stage, allowing a retry or restart of the current stage progression.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: ResetCurrentStageStep
**Purpose**: Reset current stage progression
**Usage**: Retrying an experiment sequence within the same stage

## 📋 Basic Prerequisites

1. **Current Stage Context**: Must be used within an active stage
2. **Stage Progression**: Current stage must have progression to reset
3. **Reset Permission**: User/system must have permission to reset stage

## 📝 Parameters

- (None) Operates on current stage context

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Retry Stage Flow
```
ShowMessage (Retrying stage) → ResetCurrentStageStep → ProgressMapAutoNextStep
```

## 🚨 Critical ResetCurrentStageStep Rules
- **Current Stage Only**: Resets only the current active stage
- **Stage Progression**: Clears current stage progression for retry
- **Not for Specific Stages**: Use ResetStageByNumberStep for specific stage resets

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing with ResetStageByNumberStep**: Use ResetStageByNumberStep for specific stage resets
2. **Using for stage transitions**: Use GoToStageStep for stage transitions
3. **Using without user confirmation**: Always confirm user intent before destructive resets

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Confirm user intent before destructive resets** to prevent accidental data loss
2. **Provide UI feedback that stage has been reset** for user awareness
3. **Use for current stage retry scenarios** when user wants to restart current stage
4. **Log current stage before and after reset** for debugging purposes
