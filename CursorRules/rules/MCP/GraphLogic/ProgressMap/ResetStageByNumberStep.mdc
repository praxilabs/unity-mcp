# ResetStageByNumberStep Node

## Overview
Resets progression for a specific stage identified by its number for targeted stage reset operations.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: ResetStageByNumberStep
**Purpose**: Reset stage by number
**Usage**: Retrying experiment from a particular stage, jumping back

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Valid Stage Number**: Target stage number must exist in the experiment
2. **Stage Configuration**: Stage must be properly configured in progress map
3. **Reset Permission**: User/system must have permission to reset stage

## Parameters

- **stageNumber**: Target stage number to reset

## Common Patterns

### Targeted Stage Reset
```
ShowMessage (Resetting Stage 2) → ResetStageByNumberStep (stageNumber: 2) → ProgressMapManualNextStep (stepNumber: 1)
```

## Critical ResetStageByNumberStep Rules
- **Specific Stage Reset**: Resets progression for a specific stage by number
- **Stage Number Required**: Must provide valid stage number parameter
- **Not for Current Stage**: Use ResetCurrentStageStep for current stage resets

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using wrong stage identifier**: Use stage number, not stage name
2. **Not re-navigating after reset**: Provide navigation after reset
3. **Using for current stage**: Use ResetCurrentStageStep for current stage resets
4. **Invalid stage number**: Verify stage number exists in progress configuration

## Best Practices

1. **Confirm stage index mapping is up to date** to ensure valid stage numbers
2. **Provide UI feedback when a reset occurs** for user awareness
3. **Use for specific stage resets** when targeting particular stages
4. **Log selected stage number** for debugging purposes
5. **Verify stage exists in progress configuration** before execution
