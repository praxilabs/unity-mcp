# NewEvents Nodes

## ðŸ“‹ Overview
NewEvents nodes handle event-driven interactions and reactive programming in virtual lab experiments. Essential for cross-graph signaling and reactive behaviors.

## ðŸ”§ Available Nodes

### EventCallerStep
**Rule File**: [EventCallerStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/NewEvents/EventCallerStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Event-driven trigger step for invoking registered events
**Usage**: Reactive programming, event handling, cross-graph signaling

## ðŸš¨ Critical NewEvents Rules
- **Event Registration**: All events must be registered in the Event Registry
- **Event Names**: Use exact event names to avoid typos
- **Reactive Programming**: Use for event-driven behaviors and cross-graph communication

## ðŸŽ¯ Node Selection Guide

### **Use EventCallerStep for:**
- Event-driven interactions and reactive programming
- Cross-graph signaling and communication
- Triggering registered events during experiment flow
- Reactive behaviors based on experiment state
