# GoToStageStep Node

## Overview
Ends the current stage and transitions to a specified next stage for stage management and experiment flow control.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: GoToStageStep
**Purpose**: Stage transition control
**Usage**: End of a stage, skipping stages

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Valid Stage Number**: Target stage must exist in the experiment
2. **Experiment Data Setup**: Stage must be added to Experiment Data with correct references
3. **Stage Configuration**: Target stage must be properly configured

## Parameters

- **Target Stage**: Identifier of the stage to transition to

## Common Patterns

### Stage Transition
```
`...` is a variable number of nodes that performs a certain logic.

... → GoToStageStep (NextStage)
```

### Conditional Stage Skip
```
`...` is a variable number of nodes that performs a certain logic.

IfStatementStep (SkipIntro) → True: GoToStageStep (MainStage)
                            → False: ...
```

## Critical GoToStageStep Rules
- **Stage Transitions Only**: Use for stage transitions, not step progression
- **Valid Target Stage**: Target stage must exist and be properly configured
- **Not for Step Completion**: Use ProgressMapAutoNextStep for step progression
