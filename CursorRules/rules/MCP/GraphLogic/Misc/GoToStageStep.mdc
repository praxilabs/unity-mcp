# GoToStageStep Node

## Overview
Ends the current stage and transitions to a specified next stage for stage management and experiment flow control.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: GoToStageStep
**Purpose**: Stage transition control
**Usage**: End of a stage, skipping stages

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Valid Stage Number**: Target stage must exist in the experiment
2. **Experiment Data Setup**: Stage must be added to Experiment Data with correct references
3. **Stage Configuration**: Target stage must be properly configured

## Parameters

- **Target Stage**: Identifier/name of the stage to transition to
- **Transition Delay**: Optional delay before switching (s)
- **Carry State**: Whether to persist certain state across stages

## Common Patterns

### Stage Transition
```
CompleteStageActions → GoToStageStep (NextStage) → Continue
```

### Conditional Stage Skip
```
IfStatementStep (SkipIntro) → True: GoToStageStep (MainStage)
                           → False: Continue
```

## Critical GoToStageStep Rules
- **Stage Transitions Only**: Use for stage transitions, not step progression
- **Valid Target Stage**: Target stage must exist and be properly configured
- **Not for Step Completion**: Use ProgressMapAutoNextStep for step progression

## Common Mistakes

1. **Using to mark a step finished**: Use ProgressMapAutoNextStep instead for step progression
2. **Target stage not found**: Verify stage exists in progress map/config
3. **Wrong stage identifier**: Ensure stage name/number matches exactly
4. **Using for step completion**: Use ProgressMapAutoNextStep for step completion

## Best Practices

1. **Keep transitions explicit and well-documented** for clarity
2. **Provide user feedback before switching stages** for better UX
3. **Verify stage exists in progress map/config** before execution
4. **Use for stage transitions only** not step progression
5. **Log selected stage id/name** for debugging purposes
