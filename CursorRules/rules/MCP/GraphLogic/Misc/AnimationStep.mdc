# AnimationStep Node

## Overview
Plays an animation or triggers an animated effect on a target object for visual feedback and interactive responses.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: AnimationStep
**Purpose**: Animation control and playback
**Usage**: Object animations, visual effects, click-triggered responses

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Animator Component**: Object must have an Animator component
2. **Object Registration**: Target object must be registered in the Item Registry
3. **Animation Clip**: Animation clip or state must exist on the Animator

## Parameters

- **Target Object**: Object that holds the Animator/animation
- **Animation Name**: Clip or state to play
- **Play Mode**: One-shot, loop, crossfade
- **Transition Duration**: Crossfade time (s)
- **Speed**: Playback speed multiplier

## Common Patterns

### Interactive Animation
```
ClickStep (Object) → AnimationStep (Response animation) → ShowMessage (Animation complete)
```

### Visual Feedback
```
Action → AnimationStep (Visual feedback) → Continue
```

### Animation with Sound
```
AnimationStep (Visual effect) → AudioStep (Sound effect) → Continue
```

## Critical AnimationStep Rules
- **Animator Required**: Target object must have Animator component
- **Animation State**: Animation clip/state must exist on the Animator
- **Timing Control**: Use appropriate play modes for different scenarios

## Common Mistakes

1. **Missing Animator/clip on target**: Verify Animator component and animation clips exist
2. **Wrong animation state name**: Verify animation state names match exactly
3. **No transition time for crossfades**: Use appropriate transition duration to avoid pops
4. **Using for non-animation effects**: Use other nodes for non-animation visual effects

## Best Practices

1. **Keep clips short and responsive** for better user experience
2. **Use crossfades for UX polish** to avoid jarring transitions
3. **Reset state as needed before replay** for consistent behavior
4. **Test at 1.0 speed before tweaking** to ensure proper timing
5. **Verify clip names and layer indexes** before execution
