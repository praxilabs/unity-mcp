# AnimationStep Node

## Overview
Plays an animation or triggers an animated effect on a target object for visual feedback and interactive responses.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: AnimationStep
**Purpose**: Animation control and playback
**Usage**: Object animations, visual effects, click-triggered responses

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Animator Component**: Object must have an Animator component
2. **Object Registration**: Target object must be registered in the Item Registry
3. **Animation Clip**: Animation clip or state must exist on the Animator

## Parameters

- **_animationTriggerName**: the name of the Trigger used for animation.
- **_numberOfRounds**: the number of times the animation will play.
- **_dontCallEnd**: boolean to identify whether to call the End Trigger to exit the state of the animation or not.
- **_freezeUI**: boolean to identify whether the UI freezes when the animaition plays or not.
- **_freezeCameraMove**: boolean to identify whether the camera movement stops when the animation plays or not.
- **_freezeCameraRotate**: boolean to identify whether the camera rotation stops when the animation plays or not.

## Common Patterns

### Interactive Animation
```
`...` is a variable number of nodes that have a certain logic.

ClickStep (Object) → AnimationStep (Response animation) → ...
```


## Critical AnimationStep Rules
- **Animator Required**: Target object must have Animator component
- **Animation State**: Animation clip/state must exist on the Animator
- **Timing Control**: Use appropriate play modes for different scenarios
