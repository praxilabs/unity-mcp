# SetCurrentStageStep Node

## Overview
Sets the experiment's current stage to a specified stage for explicit stage navigation and resuming from specific points.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: SetCurrentStageStep
**Purpose**: Set active stage
**Usage**: Navigate/resume from a specific stage

## Basic Prerequisites

1. **Valid Stage Name**: Target stage must exist in the experiment
2. **Stage Configuration**: Stage must be properly configured
3. **Stage Registry**: Stage must be registered in the stage registry

## Parameters

- **stageName**: Target stage identifier

## Common Patterns

### Conditional Stage Setting
```
IfStatementStep (Condition) → SetCurrentStageStep (SuccessStage)
IfStatementStep (NOT Condition) → SetCurrentStageStep (FailureStage)
```

## Critical SetCurrentStageStep Rules
- **Explicit Stage Navigation**: Use for explicit stage navigation and resuming
- **Stage Setting**: Sets the current active stage to specified stage
- **Conditional Routing**: Enables conditional stage routing based on conditions

## Common Mistakes

1. **Mismatched stage names**: Verify stage name matches exactly
2. **Using for data operations**: Use data nodes for data operations
3. **Invalid stage name**: Verify stage exists in registry
4. **Using for stage progression**: Use EnableStageStep for stage progression

## Best Practices

1. **Centralize stage name constants** to avoid typos and maintain consistency
2. **Log stage changes** for debugging purposes
3. **Use for explicit stage navigation** when precise control is needed
4. **Verify stage exists in registry** before execution
5. **Use for conditional stage routing** based on experiment conditions
