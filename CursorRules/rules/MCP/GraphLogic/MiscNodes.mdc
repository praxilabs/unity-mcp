# Animation Step Nodes

## 📋 Overview
Animation Step nodes handle animation control and playback in virtual lab experiments. These nodes are essential for object animations and visual effects.

## 🔧 Available Nodes

### AnimationStep
**Purpose**: Animation control and playback
**Usage**: Object animations, visual effects
**Best Practices**:
- Use for visual feedback and effects

### GameObjectSetActiveStep
**Purpose**: Show and Hide GameObjects at scene.
**Usage**: when you are requested to show or hide objects at scene.
**Best Practices**:
- use it in the context of the request.

### GoToStageStep
**Purpose**: ending the current stage and starting another stage.
**Usage**: end of a stage, skipping stages.


## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Click to Animation Pattern
```
ClickStep (Object) → AnimationStep(object) → Return
```

### Animation Sequence Pattern
```
AnimationStep (Animation 1) → DelayStep → AnimationStep (Animation 2) → Continue
```

### Interactive Animation Pattern
```
UserAction → AnimationStep (Response animation) → ShowMessage (Animation complete) → Continue
```

### Visual Feedback Pattern
```
Action → AnimationStep (Visual feedback) → Continue
```

### Animation with Sound Pattern
```
AnimationStep (Visual effect) → AudioStep (Sound effect) → Continue
```

### Click ObjectA to Activate/Show Object ObjectB
```
ClickStep (ObjectA) →  GameObjectSetActiveStep (ObjectB, True) 
```
### Starting an experiment by showing objects
```
Start → GameObjectSetActiveStep (Object, True) → Continue
```


## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Complete Requirement Implementation
**When user mentions "click makes animation" or similar, ALWAYS implement:**
```
ClickStep (Object) → AnimationStep(object) 
```
**NOT just:**
```
ClickStep (Object) → nothing
```

**Examples:**
- "Click tube makes shaking animation" = ClickStep → AnimationStep
- "Click dropper triggers effect" = ClickStep → AnimationStep  
- "Click button plays animation" = ClickStep → AnimationStep

**Always verify each step includes ALL required components, not just the primary action.**

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Incomplete animation implementation**: When user mentions "click makes animation", implement ClickStep → AnimationStep, not just ClickStep
2. **Missing object verification**: Always verify object exists in registry
3. **Wrong animation timing**: Use appropriate animation durations
4. **Missing visual feedback**: Provide clear animation responses

## 🔍 Debugging Tips

2. **Test animations** one step at a time
4. **Use DelayStep** to slow down for debugging
