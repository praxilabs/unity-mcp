# Attach-Detach Nodes

## Overview
Attach-Detach nodes handle object attachment and detachment in virtual lab experiments. Essential for equipment assembly, component connections, and interactive object manipulation.

## Available Nodes

### AttachStep
**Rule File**: [AttachStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/AttachDetach/AttachStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Attach objects together (attachment only, not locking)
**Usage**: Equipment assembly, component connections
** Critical**: Use FunctionCallStep for locking after attachment

### DetachStep
**Rule File**: [DetachStep.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/MCP/GraphLogic/AttachDetach/DetachStep.mdc)
**Purpose**: Detach objects from each other
**Usage**: Equipment disassembly, component removal

## Common Misinterpretations
- **AttachStep ≠ Locking**: AttachStep only attaches objects; use FunctionCallStep for locking
- **Sequential Operations**: Always execute attachment/detachment operations sequentially
- **Prerequisites**: Objects must have proper colliders and scripts for attachment to work
