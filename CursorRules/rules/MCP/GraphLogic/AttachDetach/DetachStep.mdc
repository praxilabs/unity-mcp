# DetachStep Node

## Overview
DetachStep handles object detachment in virtual lab experiments. This node is essential for equipment disassembly, component removal, and interactive object manipulation.

## Description Context.
The description of the node must contain which object will have the prerequisites, explicitly mention the object name.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: DetachStep
**Purpose**: Detach one object from another object
**Usage**: Equipment disassembly, component removal, interactive object manipulation

## Basic Prerequisites

1. Must be attached to another object (executed the Attach Step on it before).

## Parameters
- **Object 1**: The object to be detached (source object)


## Common Patterns

### Detachment after Attachment.
```
AttachStep(ObjA, ObjB) → ... → DetachStep(ObjA, ObjB).
```

## Common Mistakes
1. **Incomplete detachment flow**: Ensure detachment leads to appropriate actions
