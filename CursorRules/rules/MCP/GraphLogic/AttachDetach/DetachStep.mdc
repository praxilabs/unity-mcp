# DetachStep Node

## 📋 Overview
DetachStep handles object detachment in virtual lab experiments. This node is essential for equipment disassembly, component removal, and interactive object manipulation.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: DetachStep
**Purpose**: Detach one object from another object
**Usage**: Equipment disassembly, component removal, interactive object manipulation

## 📋 Basic Prerequisites

<!-- Required data and setup needed for this node step to work -->

**For the object being detached:**
1. Must be attached to other object
2. AttachableTool Script
3. Trigger Collider
4. Draggable tag
5. DraggableObject Script

## 📝 Parameters

- **Object 1**: The object to be detached (source object)
- **Object 2**: The object to detach from (destination object)
- **Detachment Point**: Specific detachment location/transform
- **Visual Feedback**: Optional visual confirmation of detachment

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Basic Detachment
```
DetachStep (SourceObject, TargetObject) → ShowMessage (Detachment Complete)
```

### Component Removal Flow
```
DetachStep (Component, Base) → GameObjectSetActiveStep (hide component) → ShowMessage (Component Removed)
```

### Sequential Disassembly
```
DetachStep (Cover, Remote) → DelayStep → DetachStep (Battery, Remote) → ShowMessage (Disassembly Complete)
```

### Conditional Detachment
```
IfStatementStep (Check condition) → True: DetachStep → Continue
                                → False: ShowMessage (Cannot detach)
```

### Detachment with Visual Feedback
```
DetachStep → GameObjectSetActiveStep (show detachment indicator) → ShowMessage (Detached successfully)
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Missing object verification**: Always verify both objects exist in registry
2. **Wrong object references**: Verify object references are valid
3. **Missing detachment points**: Ensure detachment points exist and are valid
4. **Incomplete detachment flow**: Ensure detachment leads to appropriate actions
5. **Missing detachment handling**: Always handle detachment operations properly

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Verify objects exist** before attempting detachment
2. **Provide visual feedback** for successful detachments
3. **Use appropriate delays** between detachment steps
4. **Test detachment sequences** thoroughly
5. **Handle detachment failures** gracefully
6. **Consider object state** after detachment
7. **Plan for object cleanup** after detachment
