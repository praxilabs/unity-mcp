# AttachStep Node

## Overview
AttachStep handles object attachment in virtual lab experiments. This node is essential for equipment assembly, component connections, and interactive object manipulation.

**IMPORTANT**: AttachStep only handles basic attachment - objects are NOT locked by default. Locking is a separate system that requires FunctionCallStep.

## Node Details

**Node Type**: AttachStep
**Purpose**: Attach one object to another object (attachment only, not locking)
**Usage**: Equipment assembly, component connections, interactive object manipulation
**Locking**: Use FunctionCallStep for locking after attachment

## Basic Prerequisites

2. DraggableObject Script - The DraggableObject script handles the object Dragging as the attachment proces involves dragging the object to the attachement position.
3. AttachableTool Script - The Attachable Tool Step is responsible for detecting and finalizing the Attachment of an Object.
4. Trigger Collider - The Collider that the DraggableObject Script is using is a Trigger.
5. Draggable tag - The DraggableObject Script requires a Draggable Tag to function.

## Parameters

- **Object 1**: The object to be attached (source object)
- **Object 2**: The target object to attach to (destination object)
- **Attachment Point**: Specific attachment location/transform
- **Visual Feedback**: Optional visual confirmation of attachment

## Common Patterns

### Sequential Assembly
```
AttachStep (Battery, Remote) → DelayStep → AttachStep (Cover, Remote) → ShowMessage (Assembly Complete)
```

### Conditional Attachment
```
IfStatementStep (Check condition) → True: AttachStep → Continue
                                → False: ShowMessage (Cannot attach)
```

### Sequential Attachment and Locking
```
AttachStep (Capsule, WeighingPaper) → FunctionCallStep (Lock Capsule) → Continue
```

## Common Mistakes
1. **Incomplete attachment flow**: Ensure attachment leads to appropriate actions
2. **Confusing attachment with locking**: AttachStep only attaches, use FunctionCallStep for locking
