# AttachStep Node

## 📋 Overview
AttachStep handles object attachment in virtual lab experiments. This node is essential for equipment assembly, component connections, and interactive object manipulation.

**IMPORTANT**: AttachStep only handles basic attachment - objects are NOT locked by default. Locking is a separate system that requires FunctionCallStep.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: AttachStep
**Purpose**: Attach one object to another object (attachment only, not locking)
**Usage**: Equipment assembly, component connections, interactive object manipulation
**Locking**: Use FunctionCallStep for locking after attachment

## 📋 Basic Prerequisites
<!-- Required data and setup needed for this node step to work -->

**For the object being attached:**
1. AttachableTool Script
2. Trigger Collider
3. Draggable tag
4. DraggableObject Script
5. Hologram (Optional)

## 📝 Parameters

- **Object 1**: The object to be attached (source object)
- **Object 2**: The target object to attach to (destination object)
- **Attachment Point**: Specific attachment location/transform
- **Visual Feedback**: Optional visual confirmation of attachment

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Basic Attachment
```
AttachStep (SourceObject, TargetObject) → ShowMessage (Attachment Complete)
```

### Sequential Assembly
```
AttachStep (Battery, Remote) → DelayStep → AttachStep (Cover, Remote) → ShowMessage (Assembly Complete)
```

### Conditional Attachment
```
IfStatementStep (Check condition) → True: AttachStep → Continue
                                → False: ShowMessage (Cannot attach)
```

### Attachment with Visual Feedback
```
AttachStep → GameObjectSetActiveStep (show attachment indicator) → ShowMessage (Attached successfully)
```

### Attachment with Locking (if needed)
```
AttachStep (ObjectA, ObjectB) → FunctionCallStep (Lock ObjectA) → ShowMessage (Object locked)
```

### Sequential Attachment and Locking
```
AttachStep (Capsule, WeighingPaper) → FunctionCallStep (Lock Capsule) → Continue
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Missing object verification**: Always verify both objects exist in registry
2. **Wrong object references**: Verify object references are valid
3. **Missing attachment points**: Ensure attachment points exist and are valid
4. **Incomplete attachment flow**: Ensure attachment leads to appropriate actions
5. **Confusing attachment with locking**: AttachStep only attaches, use FunctionCallStep for locking

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Verify objects exist** before attempting attachment
2. **Provide visual feedback** for successful attachments
3. **Use appropriate delays** between attachment steps
4. **Test attachment sequences** thoroughly
5. **Handle attachment failures** gracefully
6. **Separate attachment from locking**: Use AttachStep for attachment, FunctionCallStep for locking
7. **Follow attachment-locking pattern**: AttachStep → FunctionCallStep (Lock) → Continue
