      <description>This is a ROUTING RULE ONLY - it does not provide functional tools or capabilities. This rule only routes you to the appropriate node rules for detailed implementation. For actual node implementation, refer to the specific node rules: AttachStep.mdc and DetachStep.mdc.</description>

    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>AttachStep only handles basic attachment - objects are NOT locked by default. Locking is a separate system that requires FunctionCallStep.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Always execute attachment/detachment operations sequentially. Objects must have proper colliders and scripts for attachment to work.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use conditional attachment patterns with IfStatementStep for decision points. Ensure attachment leads to appropriate actions.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="medium">
      <description>DetachStep requires objects to be previously attached. Use detachment after attachment patterns for proper disassembly flow.</description>
