# Progress Map Nodes

## üìã Overview
Progress Map nodes handle progress tracking and navigation in virtual lab experiments. These nodes are essential for experiment progress and navigation control.

## üîß Available Nodes

### ProgressMapAutoNextStep
**Purpose**: Automatically Handles progress tracking and navigation
**Usage**: Experiment progress, navigation control
**Best Practices**:
- Use for progress tracking scenarios
- Handle navigation appropriately
- Connect to progress responses

### ProgressMapManualNextStep
**Purpose**: Manually Handles progress tracking and navigation by giving the next step index, can be used to skip steps in the progression system.
**Usage**: Experiment progress, navigation control
**Best Practices**:
- Use for progress tracking scenarios
- Handle navigation appropriately
- Connect to progress responses

### ResetCurrentStageStep
**Purpose**: Resets the current progression of the current stage
**Usage**: Retrying Experiment, ending the current experiment and starting a new stage.
**Best Practices**:
- Use for progress tracking scenarios
- Handle navigation appropriately
- Connect to progress responses

### ResetStageByNumberStep
**Purpose**: Resets the stage progression by stage number.
**Usage**: Retrying Experiment, ending the current experiment and starting a new stage.
**Best Practices**:
- Use for progress tracking scenarios
- Handle navigation appropriately
- Connect to progress responses

## üèóÔ∏è Common Patterns

```
normal usage: at the end of a stage or after finishing an experiment step to get to the next progression level.
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

1. **Missing progress updates**: Always update progress appropriately
2. **Wrong navigation triggers**: Use appropriate navigation controls
3. **Incomplete progress flow**: Ensure complete progress handling

## üîç Debugging Tips

1. **Test progress tracking** one step at a time
2. **Verify navigation flow** is complete
3. **Check progress references** are valid
4. **Use DelayStep** to slow down for debugging
