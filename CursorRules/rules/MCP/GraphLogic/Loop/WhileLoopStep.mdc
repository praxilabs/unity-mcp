description: Conditional iteration control for dynamic repetition based on a boolean condition

# WhileLoopStep Node

## 📋 Overview
Repeats its body while a boolean condition remains true for conditional repetition and dynamic loops with unknown iteration count.

## 🔧 Node Details

**Node Type**: WhileLoopStep
**Purpose**: Conditional iteration control
**Usage**: Conditional repetition, dynamic loops

## 📝 Parameters

- **condition**: Boolean expression/source determining whether to continue
- **pollingInterval**: Optional delay between checks (seconds)

## 🔌 Ports

- **continueLoop (Output)**: Connect the loop body here; executed each time condition is true
- **exit (Output)**: Called once when condition becomes false

## 🏗️ Common Patterns

### Conditional Loop Pattern
```
WhileLoopStep (condition) → continueLoop: Action → Self
                         → exit: Continue
```

### Interactive Loop Pattern
```
WhileLoopStep (user continues) → continueLoop: UserAction → WhileLoopStep (check)
                              → exit: Complete
```

## 🚨 Critical WhileLoopStep Rules
- **Conditional Iteration**: Use for unknown iteration count based on changing conditions
- **Port Connections**: Use `continueLoop` for loop body, `exit` for completion
- **Condition Safety**: Ensure condition can become false to prevent infinite loops

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Infinite loops**: Ensure the condition can flip to false
2. **Wrong port connections**: Use continueLoop for body, exit for completion
3. **Missing global variables/inputs**: Connect condition to proper data sources
4. **Using for fixed iteration count**: Use ForLoopStep for known iteration counts

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Keep loop body side effects controlled** to avoid unintended consequences
2. **Externalize condition evaluation** to test easily
3. **Provide a clear exit pathway** to prevent infinite loops
4. **Add safety counter or timeout** during testing
5. **Use DelayStep to throttle checks** for performance
