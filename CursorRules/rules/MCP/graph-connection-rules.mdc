# Graph Connection Rules

## CRITICAL CONNECTION RULES

### **MANDATORY NODE CONNECTION REQUIREMENTS**

1. **First Step Node Rule**: 
   - **NEVER connect TO the entry port of a first step node**
   - **MUST connect FROM the exit port of a first step node**
   - First step nodes can only have outgoing connections

2. **End Node Rule**: 
   - **NEVER connect FROM the exit port of an end node**
   - **MUST connect TO the entry port of an end node**
   - End nodes can only have incoming connections

3. **Middle Node Rule**: 
   - **ALL middle nodes MUST have BOTH incoming AND outgoing connections**
   - **Incoming**: From previous node's exit port
   - **Outgoing**: To next node's entry port
   - **Violation**: If a middle node lacks either connection, your logic is 100% incorrect

4. **Sequential Execution Rule**: 
   - **When disabling/enabling multiple colliders sequentially**: Execute ONE at a time
   - **Standard operations**: Use sequential execution for most operations
   - **Parallel execution**: Only allowed with CompositeStep for specific scenarios
   - **Correct Pattern**: Node1.exit → Node2.entry → Node2.exit → Node3.entry → Node3.exit → Node4.entry
   - **Wrong Pattern**: Multiple nodes → Single target (creates unintended parallel execution)

**VIOLATION OF THESE RULES WILL RESULT IN BROKEN EXPERIMENTS**

## Connection Patterns

### Sequential Execution
```
Node1.exit → Node2.entry → Node2.exit → Node3.entry → Node3.exit → Node4.entry
```

### Parallel Execution (CompositeStep)
```
CompositeStep.routes → [Node1, Node2, Node3] → CompositeStep.entry
```

### Conditional Branching
```
IfStatementStep.True → ActionA → Continue
IfStatementStep.False → ActionB → Continue
```

## Common Connection Mistakes

1. **Connecting TO first step entry**: Never connect to the entry port of a first step
2. **Connecting FROM end step exit**: Never connect from the exit port of an end step
3. **Missing connections**: Middle nodes must have both incoming and outgoing
4. **Parallel collider operations**: Always execute collider operations sequentially
5. **Floating nodes**: Every node must be part of the execution flow
