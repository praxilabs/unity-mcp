      <description>This is a ROUTING RULE ONLY - it does not provide functional tools or capabilities. This rule only routes you to the appropriate node rules for detailed implementation. For actual node implementation, refer to the specific node rules: ProgressMapAutoNextStep.mdc, ProgressMapManualNextStep.mdc, ResetCurrentStageStep.mdc, and ResetStageByNumberStep.mdc.</description>

    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use ProgressMapAutoNextStep for automatic step progression, end of step/phase completion, and moving forward without manual indices.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use ProgressMapManualNextStep for precise step control, skipping steps in progression, and specific step index navigation.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use ResetCurrentStageStep for resetting current stage progression, retrying experiment within same stage, and clearing current stage state.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="high">
      <description>Use ResetStageByNumberStep for resetting specific stage by number, jumping back to particular stage, and targeted stage reset operations.</description>
    </requirement>
    <requirement priority="critical">
      <description>Distinguish between step progression and stage transitions. Use ProgressMap nodes for step progression, GoToStageStep for stage transitions.</description>
    </requirement>
  </requirements>
  <context description="Additional considerations for progress map nodes">
    Progress Map nodes handle progress tracking and navigation in virtual lab experiments. Essential for experiment progression, step management, and stage control. These nodes work within the current stage context and should not be confused with stage transition operations.
